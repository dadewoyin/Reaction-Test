# Reaction-Test
A reaction tester game using Javascript

This is a project I worked on with the goal of getting a better understanding of JavaScript. Using functions to get random colors, onclick, Date.now, and a few others, I created a simple little game for a user to play while he/she passes some time by. How fast can you click the target?
